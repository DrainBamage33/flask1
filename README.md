# Flask1

## Square 0

 - [ ] Learned basic flask and also hands-on javascript
 - [ ] Learned how to GET and POST to pages and also APIs
 - [ ] Learned basic way to secure API key on Github(by not pushing it at all that is:p)
 - [ ] Learned how to deploy on heroku (https://ydl-test.herokuapp.com/)

## How?
From home page go to youtube search test link and it requires search+your google API key(yep), click search and hope for the best. If you are lucky you will be able to download .mp3 files.
